## NOTE to users who made custom changes to previous versions:
##
## The format of regular expressions used here were changed
## as of ssh version 7.1.2 being released Q3/2010.
##
## Oldest ssh versions used shell style e.g. '*'
## Recent versions could be configured for both shell style '*'
## and standard regexp '.*' using the VERSION/REGEX-STYLE tags
## at the top of this template.  New versions 7.x now accept
## only standard POSIX style regexp '.*'
##
## We hope this type of change never will happen again, and all
## future upgrades can be fully automated within this section
## controlled by IT/Engineering Computing, while your custom
## changes below can be reused with no action required.

#                  CAUTION!
# The following can be bad - do not be tempted to use
# short *.sitedomain for intel hosts.  You may get
# unexpected failures where real DNS domains exist
# on the outside Internet.  If they do not exist
# today, they may be registered in the future and
# you will not easily recognize why this breaks.
# Example: .ch is the country of Switzerland.
#
# In most cases the system-controlled list of network
# numbers should  cover these destinations adequately.
# The newest ssh version actually applies the network
# selections with higher precedence than the hostname
# if both exist in this file.

#                  ALTERNATIVE

#	QuietMode		yes

# Troubleshooting help:
# Using above settings ssh runs with 'QuietMode yes' for most connections.
# Sometimes this will be too quiet about reporting warnings or
